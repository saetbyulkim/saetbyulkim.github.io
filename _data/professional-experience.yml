     KIM lab is currently dedicated to investigating the molecular interactions between maize and Puccinia, an obligate biotrophic fungus that causes rust disease and results in significant yield loss in corn. As part of our efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying rust disease in maize, we aim to identify rust resistance genes and corresponding fungal genes. Let's make strong rust resistant corn and sorghum.

     Since I joined Dr. Balint-Kurti's lab in 2017, I worked on genetic and biochemical analysis of the maize hypersensitive defense response and the interactions between Rp1 allels and Puccinia sorghi (common rust).
   
  accomplishments:
    - Identified a maize novel foldback transposable element through map-based cloning
    - Identified signaling components involved in modulating hypersensitive cell death in maize
    - Investigated a novel and multifaceted understanding of the maize susceptible and resistance-specific responses to Puccinia sorghi
    - Identifying and characterizing effectors of Puccinia sorghi using tobacco and maize system

    To explore the resistance mechanism between pepper and potyvirus I performed a functional study of the resistance gene including domain swapping, co-expression study and virus-induced gene silencing assay using Nicotiana benthamiana system in the same lab where I got my Ph.D 
  

  accomplishments:
    - A novel mechanism of Pvr4 resistance to potyvirus, Basic Science Research Program from the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) (September 2016 – March 2017) (2016R1A6A3A01011640)

    - Performed comparative genomics of virus resistance by constructing mapping populations in Solanaceae.
    - Generated new molecular markers using NGS and RNA-Seq to identify resistance gene.
    - Determined the role of Pvr4 against multiple potyviruses in pepper and tobacco.
    - Generated transgenic tobacco lines of Pvr4 overexpression or other resistance genes.
    - Molecular marker development, gene cloning, ligation-independent cloning (LIC), Y2H screening, Bi-FC, Southern/Northern blot, Western blot, ELISA, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), and transient assay. 

  accomplishments:
    - Outstanding Oral Presentation Award, the Korean Society for Plant Biotechnology (October 2009) 
    - National Science Fellowship from Korea Student Aid Foundation (2009–2010) (S2-2009-000-01736-1)
